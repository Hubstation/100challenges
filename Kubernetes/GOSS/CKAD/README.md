  **Challenge**: Using [Goss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss) and other tooling develop a validation framework for CKAD community challenges
  
  **Expectation**: **Goss** YAML files and index directory/repo to point to the community challenge and its validation script/Checks

    - e.g. [150 CKAD questions](https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/practice-enough-with-these-questions-for-the-ckad-exam-2f42d1228552)
      it would be nice to capture this within a community simulator and validator
